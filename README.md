# Monochromator-GUI
GUI to load and calibrate a monochromator: based on a USB2000 ocean optics
spectrometer and a Thorlabs APT translation stage.

# Notes
Note that you will need a copy of the Thorlabs APT translation stage library:
`APT.dll`, which you can get from Thorlabs. Dump it into the top directory.
